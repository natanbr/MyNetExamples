Lab 3.1: The Dispose Pattern
1.	Open the solution Jobs from the Start folder in this lab.
2.	General note: you’ll have to run this app from the command line.
3.	Implement the constructor that accepts a string:
	a.	Call NativeJob.CreateJobObject passing IntPtr.Zero and the name arguments. Store the returning handle in _hJob.
	b.	If the handle is zero, throw an InvalidOperationException.
	c.	Create the _processes object.
4.	Implement the IDisposable interface on the Job class. Use the following guidelines:
	a.	Make use of the Dispose pattern, i.e. create a Dispose(bool) method as discussed in the course.
	b.	Make sure calling Dispose multiple times is harmless, while calling anything substantial if the object is disposed throws a DisposedObjectException.
5.	Implement the Kill method by calling NativeJob.TerminateJobObject.
6.	In the Main method, create a Job object, and assign some processes to it (Use Process.Start to create some simple processes, such as “notepad” or “calc”).
7.	Call Console.ReadLine and after the user hits <enter> kill all processes in the job using the Kill instance method.
